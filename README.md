**2. Project Motivation** 
Based on the Stack Overflow Survey of 2020 I was mainly interested at the age developers / IT-related professionals start coding. Are there any differences with regard to gender, job satisfication, their education level or primary study field. 

So the main questions I wanted to answer with my analysis are the following: 
- When do people of the survey started coding? Do people with IT-related jobs start coding very early?
- Is there any difference between the gender - do men started earlier than women?
- Do people who programm as a hobby / are passionate about programming has also started earlier?
- Is there any difference with regard to the job satisfaction when people start early or later with programming?
- Is there any differences in the age distribution with regard to the education level and the primary field of study? Do people, who start early programming have a better eduction and work / study in IT relevant courses?
